  h1 8 Updates to Help Migrate and Collaborate between Skype and Teams
  p
    | Microsoft is in the process of rolling out several major updates to the way businesses will communicate using Office 365. The updates are designed around improving the migration from Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams. While less than a year-old Microsoft made a bold statement that Microsoft Teams will replace Skype for Business. Microsoft Teams is a major game changer across many organizations. The latest updates to Microsoft Office 365 will allow a slower batch or champion style deployment that will give users backward compatibility and allow IT administrators to migrate to the new app out in phases reducing the IT burden.

      | more modes that we can expect to see shortly, Islands is the most current configuration.
    p
      | Microsoft has said the following regarding Islands mode:
    blockquote
      | Islands mode comes with one-way temporary interoperability that allows chat interoperability from Teams to Skype for Business when the following conditions are met:
      | The Teams user is homed at, and enabled for, Skype for Business Online.
      | The Skype for Business user has never used Teams (or isn&rsquo;t licensed for Teams).
      | This mode is helpful when you want users who are primarily using Teams to connect with other users in the organization who are still using Skype for Business only.
      | After the users who previously used only Skype for Business start to use Teams, all their chats from other Teams users will arrive in Teams. This switches these users to islands mode. From that point, they must keep running Teams to ensure they stay connected with the other Teams users in the organization. -
      a(href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/upgrade-and-coexistence-of-skypeforbusiness-and-teams') Microsoft
    p
      | While some admins are reporting integrated connectivity between Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams for chat while in legacy mode, the setting may be blocking the connectivity within your tenant including calling, meetings, and other collaboration features.
    p
      | Microsoft does warn admins that coexistence is more complex than a simple cutover migration to Microsoft Teams. Islands mode allows an organization to conduct a proof of concept (PoC) of Teams and slowly migrate users from Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams. Islands mode doesn&rsquo;t allow a user to go back to Skype for Business and still communicate from Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams users. There is a workaround where an admin can remove Microsoft Teams licensing for the user. This drawback may be cause for concern for some organizations, each organization will need to weigh the value of migrating to Microsoft Teams prior to a more complete collaboration mode that I expect will be coming shortly.

      | Microsoft has launched a recent update to allow Microsoft Teams users to communicate with Skype for Business users. The new integration between the two apps will make it easier for users to migrate while still collaborating with colleagues that are still using Skype for Business. The new integration functionality will allow organizations to deploy Microsoft Teams to champions or specific departments prior to a full-scale deployment.
    p
      | Microsoft Teams users will see the Skype icon next to a person&rsquo;s name in the chat view. This icon indicates the user is still using Microsoft Skype for Business.

    p
      | Microsoft Teams will also warn your users in the Messages Header of a chat conversation that some functionality will not be possible between Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business Users. The loss of functionality is to be expected because Skype handles documents and other integrations differently. Since Microsoft is planning to retire Skype for Business I wouldn&rsquo;t anticipate a future update to make cross-app collaboration perfect.

I had some issues when the availability status did not update in Skype when a user made a change in Microsoft Teams.

    p
      | One of the major factors in moving to Microsoft Teams is the one-to-many chat capabilities. IT should have a plan in place for scenarios where a key member of a team or project is out of the office. Two options are available depending on your organization:
    ol
      li
        | Make a public team available for each department. If most of the departments in your organization can have their team public, where any employee can join the chat, it&rsquo;s a straightforward way to make an entire team available for any unplanned out-of-office scenarios. HR &amp; Accounting may need to manage two teams, one public and another private.
      li
        | If an organization would prefer to keep the department teams private and secured from other employees within your organization, a company should create an all company team. All employees can be a member of the team and a channel can be created for each department. If an employee ever wants to contact an entire team they can utilize the appropriate channel. PowerShell is provided at the bottom of this article to help facilitate the creation of an all company team.

    h2 Remote Deployment of Microsoft Teams
    p
      | Going almost unnoticed, Microsoft has released MSI installers for Microsoft Teams. This enables organizations to leverage System Center Configuration Manager, Group Policy, or any 3rd party distribution mechanisms for broad deployments of Microsoft Teams. Admins can download the installation bits in the following locations:
    ul
      li
        a(href='http://aka.ms/teams32bitmsi') Microsoft Teams 32-bit MSI installer
      li
        a(href='http://aka.ms/teams64bitmsi') Microsoft Teams 64-bit MSI installer
    p
      | Target machines will require Windows 7, .NET 4.5, and 3 GB of disk space for the installation. For more information on the deployment view Microsoft&rsquo;s 
      a(href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/msi-deployment') documentation
      | .
  section
    h2 Microsoft Teams &ndash; All Company team
    p
      | The following section is designed to assist you with creating an All Company team in Microsoft Teams. The team can then be used to communicate and collaborate with your entire organization. Unfortunately, the max number of members in a team is 2,500. If your organization is larger than 2,500 users, you cannot use a single team to communicate. Due to the one-to-many communication method of Microsoft Teams, I personally wouldn&rsquo;t recommend having a team larger than 1,000 members. Communication of over 1,000 employees is best implemented using SharePoint and/or Yammer.
    p Microsoft has documented a similar command shell:
    ul
      li
        a(href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/scripts/powershell-script-sample-create-company-wide-team')

          | https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/company-wide-team-creation-powershell
    p
      | To run the following commands, you must be able to connect to Azure AD &amp; Microsoft Teams using PowerShell. Connecting to Office 365 PowerShell with a user that has MFA enabled is more difficult. If you haven&rsquo;t connected to Office 365 PowerShell before and have MFA enabled, it&rsquo;s recommended to temporarily disable MFA or create a Global Admin without MFA for one-time use.
