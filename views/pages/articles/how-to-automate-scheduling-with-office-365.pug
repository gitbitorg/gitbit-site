  h1#whats-microsoft-bookings What’s Microsoft Bookings?
  p
    | Microsoft has added the Microsoft Bookings app to Office 365 Enterprise (E3 &
    | E5) customers. Bookings is an app that can simplify and automate how customers
    | schedule and manage appointments. Originally designed for small businesses,
    | Microsoft has continued to improve the product and has expanded the app to
    | enterprise customers.

  h1#why-use-microsoft-bookings Why use Microsoft Bookings?
  h2#customers-love-it Customers Love it!
  p
    | Customers love the flexibility and convenience they have when using Bookings.
    | They can visit the simple Bookings webpage on any device and schedule an
    | appointment. After scheduling an appointment, they receive a confirmation email
    | and can reschedule, or cancel if they must. With Bookings, the process for
    | customers and prospective customers is easy, fast, and flexible.
  h2#automate-and-streamline-scheduling Automate and Streamline Scheduling
  p
    | Bookings will help automate and streamline scheduling. Employees can setup
    | available times, and set time off. Then customers can book their own
    | appointments so you don’t waste time on the phone gathering information.
    | Bookings will keep your staff and customers coordinated, with little to no
    | effort.
  p
    | Thanks to the Office 365 integration, your staff can continue to use their
    | Outlook calendar as usual. If a staff member schedules a meeting in their
    | Outlook calendar, they will automatically become unavailable in Bookings. The
    | synchronization makes adding Booking to someone’s day simple, and easy.
  p
    | When a customer books an appointment, the calendar item will automatically sync
    | to your staff’s calendar, so they don’t have to go hunting for their schedules
    | or manage their Booking calendar separate from their day to day calendar. The
    | two-way sync is beautifully designed to keep staff and customers happy.
  h2#decrease-no-shows Decrease No-Shows
  p
    | Decrease no-shows with automatic reminders for customers. After a customer books
    | an appointment they’ll receive a confirmation of their booking directly in their
    | inbox. Customers can add their appointments to their own personal calendars to
    | make sure they remember the appointment in their busy lives. Bookings will send
    | a reminder email prior to the appointment.
  h2#easy-to-use Easy to Use
  p
    | Managing Bookings is easy to do, even on the go. With a web app and apps for
    | smart phones, you can keep up with customers and appointments in the office and
    | on the go. Use the app to email, call, or text customers or even add an
    | appointment for your customer.
  h1#who-should-use-bookings Who should use Bookings?
  p
    | Bookings is a fantastic app for most verticals. Add Bookings to your site and
    | offer a free consultation to help your organization grow. You can also use
    | Bookings with current customers to schedule appointments. Service organizations
    | for example, law firms, and insurance companies are finding online scheduling a
    | great way to help their organization grow.
  h1#how-to-get-bookings How to get Bookings

  h2#what-s-the-employee-experience What’s the Employee Experience
  p
    | Since Bookings automatically links to your employees’ calendars, it’s easy for
    | your staff to stay up-to-date. If an employee schedules an appointment on their
    | Outlook calendar they’ll automatically be removed from the list of available
    | staff members in Bookings. If a customer books an appointment, the employees
    | calendar will be updated too.
  p
    | When someone books an appointment without selecting a staff member, the
    | appointment will be automatically added to one of the available employees’
    | calendars. The staff member will also receive an email informing them of the new
    | appointment. The appointment will contain the customer information in case they
    | need to reschedule or send some information prior to the engagement.
  h2#what-s-the-customer-experience What’s the Customer Experience?
  p
    | Customers can easily book time without any issues. When they go to your Booking
    | site, they’ll see a simple form where they can select a service, date and time
    | and then book a request.
  p
    img(src='/assets/article/bookings/Scheduling-Screenshot.png', alt='Scheduling-Screenshot', title='Scheduling-Screenshot')

  p
    img(src='/assets/article/bookings/confirmed-booking.png', alt='Booking confirmation screenshot', title='Booking confirmation screenshot')
