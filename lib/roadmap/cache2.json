    "description": "In the past, emails sent from customers' on-premises servers and devices could have a sender email address for a domain that had not been verified as theirs. This opens up the possibility for abuse and spoofing of unowned domains. Customers should only send emails for domains they own. Domain ownership is verified for Office 365 tenants by using the Accepted Domains list. That list of domains can be viewed by going to the Mail Flow section in the Exchange Admin Center. Moving forward, any emails sent with an unverified domain in the Mail From field will have that email address changed. This applies to emails from customers' own email servers (also called \"on-premises servers\"), devices such as multi-function printers, and applications that send out emails that all make use of an Office 365 connector. The Mail From field is the sender address that email servers use to check who sent the email. This is different to the From header which is shown in email clients for recipients to see who sent it. Normally, the Mail From field and From header have the same email address, but not always. The From header will not be rewritten by this change. Problem email addresses in the Mail From field will be rewritten to use the default domain of the tenant together and any non-delivery reports will be directed back to customers' tenants to the email address bounces@contoso.com where contoso.com is the default domain of the tenant.",

    "description": "To combat email abuse, new authentication mechanisms, such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, are being used to combat the spoofing of domains by spammers. These mechanisms, however, are not compatible with the way emails have been forwarded from Office 365 to forward addresses set up for hosted mailboxes. More and more, recipient email servers are rejecting forwarded emails coming from Office 365 as the sender address is not for a domain Office 365 is allowed to send as. \n\nTo fix this issue, a sender rewriting scheme is being rolled out in Office 365 that will change the sender email address to use the domain of the tenant whose mailbox is forwarding the message. This will avoid the rejections taking place by some email servers with strict settings for their SPF checks. Specifically, the Mail From field that email servers use to determine the sender email address will be rewritten. The separate From header which contains the sender address that is shown to recipients in their email client will not be changed. If any forwarded emails fail to be delivered to the forwarded address, the non-delivery responses will be sent to the original sender of the email which has always been the case",

If A calls B, and B transfers A to C. Then the call between A and B is put on hold while the transfer is happening. If the transfer to C fails, then B can resume the original call with A. The transfer to C is termed successful if C picks up, or if A reaches C's voicemail.",

However, if a meeting organizer sent an invitation to a distribution list (counted as only 1 recipient), attendees were added as individual recipients when they responded. So after more than 500 attendees responded, the meeting organizer could no longer update the meeting because there were now more than 500 recipients. We have made a first step in fixing this issue by no longer tracking individual responses (and therefore adding recipients) once there are 400 recipients. In a future update, we’ll track meeting responses in a separate property and use that when displaying attendee responses in Outlook.",

The Business center includes an activity feed, so you can see the details of what’s happening within each of the apps—making it easy to keep up-to-date on new customer appointments, invoices and payments being created or updated by the employees in your business. The activity feed also provides suggestions on what actions to take next, such as alerting you that a payment is overdue and it’s time to resend an invoice. Because the new business apps are built to work together, you don’t waste valuable time setting up connectors or transferring data manually. A contact in one business app is automatically recognized in another, so you don’t have to input data multiple times. As a business owner, you also have full control over who on your team gets access to which business apps and related information. Office 365 Business center is available on the web.

During Targeted Release (new name for First Release), the capability will be enabled for any tenant or user set to Targeted Release, and tenant admins can configure or disable the feature. Settings that are applied during Targeted Release carry forward to Standard Release so that you can comfortably prepare for new releases. For organizations that want to allow the evergreen service to update seamlessly, no action is required, and Major Update emails can be disabled.",

    "description": "Build 16.0.8528.2147 (Version 1709) of the 32-bit version of Outlook 2016 for Windows has been updated to be Large Address Aware (LAA). This increases the maximum address space available to Outlook from 2 GB to 4 GB when it is running on a 64-bit version of Windows. This is key to improved graphics rendering in Outlook when using newer displays that support higher screen resolutions. While LAA Outlook has been extensively tested, there is the possibility that some third-party or in-house developed Outlook COM Add-ins may experience issues with the change. Only 32-bit, 1709 versions of Outlook 2016 or later and running on a 64-bit version of Windows may be impacted.
