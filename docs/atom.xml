        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Power Users Guide to Outlook 2016 Search</h1><p>Despite new apps like Slack, and Microsoft Teams email is still one of the most common and fastest growing platforms for communication. Mailboxes continue to expand, and people are receiving more emails per day year over year. The rapid growth of mailboxes is why Microsoft offers 50 GB mailboxes for all customers. Enterprise customers (E3 &amp; E5) receive 100 GB mailboxes with an archive mailbox with unlimited size.</p><p>Email usage isn&#x2019;t the only reason for mailbox expansion. Regulations, for example HIPAA, have required many organizations to retain all emails for several years. As time continues, the growing requirements for data storage by regulators will continue to expand.</p><p>While Microsoft Office 365 handles most concerns, notably storage and security, <strong>administrators and end-users face one large challenge: search</strong>. Fortunately for Office 365 / Outlook ProPlus customers, Microsoft has built searching and indexing into Outlook. Outlook&#x2019;s search is fast, dynamic, and robust.</p><p>Tapping into the mailbox search features is one of the best ways to improve productivity. Search has the capability to search across folders and mailboxes. Once you&#x2019;ve mastered searching you may no longer have to waste time organizing your inbox. By leaving everything in the inbox and improving your search ability you&#x2019;ll be able to quickly find emails from certain people, with certain keywords, and find attachments without any unneeded sorting and organizing.</p><h2><strong>Introduction to Outlook Search</strong></h2><p>Outlook 2016&#x2019;s search feature is located in the center of each page or pulled to the right.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/Outlook-Search/Search-Bar-in-O.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="Search Bar in Outlook 2016"></p><h3>Narrowing your Search</h3><p>The search will change depending on if you&#x2019;re in your inbox, calendar, people, or tasks folder. When located in your inbox, or any email folder, the search will have a drop-down box on the right-hand side to narrow your search by folder, mailbox, or everywhere.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/Outlook-Search/Outlook-Search-.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="Outlook Search bar with mailbox filter drop down"></p><h3>Word Matching: Case Sensitivity &amp; Prefix Matching</h3><p>The search is intelligently designed. Type in a word or phrase and Outlook will search the subject, body, and other fields to find a match. Searches aren&#x2019;t case sensitive, so you don&#x2019;t need to worry about searching for words with upper and lower-case characters. Outlook&#x2019;s search includes a prefix matching system too. Searching for &#x201C;build&#x201D; will return other words like &#x201C;building&#x201D;.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/Outlook-Search/Microsoft-prefi.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="Microsoft prefix searching"></p><h3>Search Ribbon</h3><p>When you click on the Search textbox Microsoft will display the Search ribbon. In the search ribbon you can narrow your search by different fields and limit your search results.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/Outlook-Search/Outlook-2016-Se.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="Outlook 2016 Search ribbon"></p><p>The ribbon is a fantastic way to limit your search. Use the ribbon if you can&#x2019;t find the email you&#x2019;re looking for after performing a keyword search. After clicking a button in the ribbon Outlook will automatically add the proper keywords to your search. Fill in the blanks and press<strong> Enter</strong> to limit your search.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/Outlook-Search/Searching-using.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="Searching using keywords in the search bar for Outlook 2016"></p><h2>Search Keyword Table</h2><p>Keywords is where we can really start to unlock the searches full potential. The search box has been integrated with a ton of search patterns and keywords to use. The easiest way to learn the keywords is by using the Search ribbon. When using the Search ribbon, the keywords will automatically be filled in on your behalf. After remembering some keywords, you can improve your search productivity and success using the keywords.</p><p><em>NOTE: Keywords AND, NOT, and OR are case-sensitive. The must be all upper-case.</em></p><h2>How to Perform an Advanced Search</h2><p>You can use the <strong>Advanced Find</strong> feature for complex searches. Advanced searches are a great way to find emails when you know information in multiple fields but cannot find the item with a normal search.</p><p>Advanced Find can be found under the <strong>Search ribbon &gt; Search Tools &gt; Advanced Find&#x2026;</strong></p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/Outlook-Search/Advanced-Find-b.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="Advanced Find button in Outlook search ribbon"></p><p>The Advanced Find box will have a ton of options for filtering and retrieving the exact item you&#x2019;re looking for.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/Outlook-Search/Advanced-find-i.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="Advanced find in Outlook 2016"></p><h2>How to Increase the Search Results in Outlook 2016</h2><p>By default, Outlook 2016 limits the number of searches returned when searching your mailbox. The default limit is set to 250. The limit is designed to improve search results speed. Outlook does have an option to return all items when you perform a search. While a bit slower, those that need to perform a lot of mailbox searches may find the change improves productivity.</p><h3>Default Search Result Limits in Outlook</h3><h3>Outlook 2016 Increase Search Results (Simple)</h3><ol><li>From Outlook go to <strong>File &gt; Options &gt; Search</strong>.</li><li>Uncheck <strong>Improve search speed by limiting the number of results shown</strong>.</li></ol><h3>Outlook 2016 Increase Search Results (Detailed)</h3><ol><li>From Outlook click the <strong>File</strong> button.<br><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/Outlook-Search/File-button-in-.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="File button in Outlook"></li><li>From the file menu, click <strong>Options</strong>. The options menu contains hundreds of settings that you can use to change how Outlook interacts. Microsoft has separated the options into different categories, mail, calendar, people, and tasks just to name a few. You&#x2019;ll find the section, or categories, listed on the left-hand side called the navigation pane.<br><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/Outlook-Search/Options-button-.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="Options button in Outlook File menu"></li><li>Click <strong>Search</strong> in the left navigation pane.<br><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/Outlook-Search/Outlook-options.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="Outlook options with Search button circled"></li><li>From the Search menu you can update how searching and indexing functions. Microsoft has included several options including indexing, what&#x2019;s searched by default, and the limit to search results. To return all results when performing a search click <strong>Improve search speed by limiting the number of results shown</strong>.<br><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/Outlook-Search/Outlook-options0.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="Outlook options search with Improve search speed by limiting the number of results shown circled"></li><li>After you uncheck the box click OK to save the settings. No reboot or Outlook restart required. Perform a search to verify the results are no longer limited.</li></ol><h2>How to Fix Common Problems with Outlook Search</h2><p>Outlook search uses Microsoft&#x2019;s built-in indexing system. Simply put, every Outlook item is indexed into a local database on the computer, as well as, on the server for fast searching. Sometimes, the index can become corrupt or misconfigured and not return the items from Outlook.</p><h3>How to Verify Local Search Issues</h3><p>When you have an issue with searching, you&#x2019;ll want to verify if you have a local problem. Open Office 365&#x2019;s OWA (<a href="https://mail.office365.com">https://mail.office365.com</a>), login, and perform a search from OWA. OWA will use the server&#x2019;s indexes and won&#x2019;t rely on the local computer. If you find the items using OWA but can&#x2019;t find the item on your local Outlook, you have a local problem.</p><p>OWA&#x2019;s search is located in the top left corner of the webpage.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/Outlook-Search/Office-365-OWA-.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="Office 365 OWA search bar"></p><h3>How to Verify Indexing is Enabled for Outlook</h3><p>Outlook is added to the indexing by default. You can add or remove Microsoft Outlook from the Index by going to <strong>Outlook &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Search &gt; Indexing Options</strong>.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/Outlook-Search/Outlook-Indexin.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="Outlook Indexing Options"></p><h3>How to Rebuild the Index</h3><p>After you verified Microsoft Outlook is being indexed, and you&#x2019;re having a local problem, the next step is rebuilding the index.</p><p>Go to<strong> Outlook &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Search &gt; Indexing Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Rebuild.</strong></p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/Outlook-Search/Outlook-Indexin0.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="Outlook Indexing options advanced menu"></p><h3>Final Solution</h3><p>If you continue to have Outlook search issues your next step is calling your IT support, partner, or Microsoft to help.</p><h2>Search on Outlook for Android &amp; iPhone</h2><p>Microsoft has recently improved the search on smartphones and tablets. If you&#x2019;re using the Outlook app on your device, you can find the search by clicking the magnifying glass in the menu.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/Outlook-Search/Outlook-app-sea.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="Outlook app search button"></p><p>After the search page opens you can use your keyword search just like Outlook on your desktop.</p><ul><li>In the top right corner, you can filter the search results by mailbox.</li><li>Right below the mailbox filter button is an attachment switch to filter by attachments.</li></ul><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/Outlook-Search/Outlook-app-sea0.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>12 Tips for Improving Productivity using&#xA0;OneNote</h1><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/OneNoteQuickTip.jpeg" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="OneNote-Quick-Tips"></p><h2>What&#x2019;s OneNote?</h2><p>OneNote is a digital notebook that automatically backs up to Microsoft&#x2019;s Office 365 cloud. Microsoft has developed apps for every device including Windows PC, Mac, iPhone, Android. OneNote notebooks can be shared with colleagues for real-time collaboration.</p><h2>Why OneNote?</h2><p>OneNote allows you to capture just about anything. Type notes, record audio, create a quick sketch, add pictures, videos, and any other document. Then organize everything into notebooks, sections, and pages. OneNote can be as structured or as unstructured as you want it to be. And because all your notes are in the cloud, OneNote lets you switch devices and pick up right where you left off.</p><p>Last but certainly not least, integration! You can take note in OneNote while on a phone call, quickly add check-boxes turning the notes into a to-do list. Then, add an Outlook flag to remind you to follow up later. Or link an Outlook calendar appointment to a OneNote page and share the notes to everyone in the meeting. The possibilities are endless.</p><h2>1. Create a Quick&#xA0;Note</h2><p>How often does this happen? In the morning, you&#x2019;re driving to work and remember you need to call a customer and follow up on your last meeting. Quick notes are perfect for capturing a thought on one device, such as your phone while driving to work, and then retrieving it from another device, such has your computer when you&#x2019;re in the office.</p><p>Use Quick Notes to jot down any thoughts and ideas, just like sticky notes. Each Quick Note is instantly saved as a page in the <strong>Unfiled Notes</strong> section of the <strong>Quick Notes</strong> notebook.</p><p><em>Quick Notes are the electronic equivalent of little yellow sticky notes. When you create a Quick Note, it&#x2019;s saved immediately as a section in &lt;your name&gt; Notebook. OneNote uses both the Quick Notes and &lt;your name&gt; Notebook to sync your notes to OneDrive. For this reason, don&#x2019;t rename the &lt;your name&gt; Notebook or the Quick Notes section.</em></p><h3>How to create a quick note on smartphones</h3><p><em>The following instructions are for an Android smartphone but are similar on iPhone. If you have any difficulty with your iPhone please let me know if the comments and I&#x2019;ll write up instructions.</em></p><p>Once you download the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.onenote&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">OneNote Android app</a> and login to your Office 365 account you can begin using OneNote on your smartphone anytime, anywhere. OneNote for Android has <strong>widgets</strong> for creating a new <strong>text</strong> note, <strong>audio</strong> note, and <strong>picture</strong> note. To use any of these widgets, simply tap and drag them to your phone&#x2019;s home screen.</p><p>From your Android home screen, tap and hold until the management view appears. Click WIDGETS.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/Add-OneNote-Qui.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="Add OneNote Quick Note to Android"></p><p>Scroll down until you find the <strong>OneNote</strong> app. Scroll through the different widgets and add them to your home screen!</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/Add-OneNote-to-.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="Add OneNote to Android"></p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/Android-with-On.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="Android with OneNote Quick Notes"></p><h3>How to create a quick note from Windows&#xA0;10</h3><p>Quick notes are located in the bottom right corner. The icon will look like the OneNote symbol plus scissors.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/Windows-10-OneN.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="Windows 10 OneNote Icon"></p><h3>How to access your quick&#xA0;notes</h3><ol><li>Open OneNote and click <strong>Quick Notes</strong>.</li></ol><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/OneNote-Quick-N.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="OneNote Quick Notes"></p><h2>2. Search across all your&#xA0;notes</h2><p>The more you use OneNote the more content you&#x2019;ll store. It can quickly become your go to place for everything and anything. The structure of OneNote has unlimited options. If you&#x2019;re like me, you&#x2019;ll quickly forget where you stored things! Luckily the built-in search is fantastic.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/OneNote-Search.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="OneNote Search"></p><p>OneNote can help you find notes no matter where they are. To find notes, select the magnifying glass or press Ctrl+F and type a search word or phrase. OneNote searches typed text, handwritten notes, and even words shown in pictures. If you want to narrow the search, select the drop-down arrow and choose an option. And OneNote highlights the search words in pictures and in notes. When you&#x2019;re done, select the X to close the search results.</p><p>With OneNote, find you notes wherever they are.</p><h2>3. Share your notebook and collaborate in real-time</h2><p>OneNote&#x2019;s possibilities don&#x2019;t end with shopping lists, and personal to-do lists. In today&#x2019;s day in age, teams need to collaborate in real-time, from anywhere. OneNote notebooks can be used to keep projects organized, share notes about clients with your team, share the highlights and action items from meetings, and provide an internal Wiki to store processes.</p><p>You can invite people to see your notebook with an email message generated by OneNote. Only people who are invited will be able to open your notebook.</p><ol><li>Choose <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Share</strong>.</li></ol><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/OneNote-Sharing.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="OneNote Sharing"></p><p>2. Under <strong>Share with People</strong>, type the names or email addresses of people you&#x2019;d like to share your notebook with.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/OneNote-Sharing0.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="OneNote Sharing Edit Permissions"></p><p>3. In the drop-down box on the right, choose whether each person can edit or just view your notebook.</p><p>4. Add a personal note, if you&#x2019;d like, and choose <strong>Share</strong>.<br>The people you&#x2019;ve selected will get an email invitation to open your notebook.</p><h2>4. Draw and hand write notes for&#xA0;clarity</h2><p>Sometimes computers can get in the way. Until I started using OneNote I kept a pen and paper on my desk at all times. It was easy to jot quick notes from a phone call, make a quick drawing to capture a complex idea or circle important things. In OneNote, you can type notes, write notes, convert handwritten notes to text, and even draw directly on the page.</p><p>From any OneNote page select the <strong>Draw </strong>tab in the ribbon and click your desired pen.</p><h2>5. Use tags to categorize and prioritize notes</h2><p>Tags are a way to categorize and prioritize notes in OneNote 2016. With tags, you can quickly return to important items, remind yourself about action items, or filter on notes you&#x2019;d like to share with others. You can tag anything from a single line of text to an entire paragraph.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/OneNote-Tags.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="OneNote Tags"></p><p><em>Tips: When you&#x2019;re done with a tagged note, you can remove the tag so it doesn&#x2019;t show up in tagged notes search results.</em></p><ul><li><em>To remove a single tag, right-click it, and click Remove Tag.</em></li><li><em>To remove multiple tags, select all of the text containing the tags you want to remove, and then press CTRL+0 (ZERO).</em></li></ul><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/OneNote-Tags-Al.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="OneNote Tags All"></p><p>If you&#x2019;ve previously added tags to any of your notes, you can search for the tags by using tag keywords. In OneNote 2016, the results appear in an easy-to-read summary. If you want to view the tag search results as a notes page, click the &#x201C;Create Summary Page&#x201D; button at the bottom of the Tags Summary task pane.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/OneNote-Tag-Sea.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="OneNote Tag Search"></p><h2>6. Integrate OneNote with Outlook&#xA0;Flags</h2><p>Now, we&#x2019;re getting to OneNote&#x2019;s true potential! As you take notes and plan projects in OneNote, you might wonder how to manage deadlines and remember the things on your to-do list. One way is to create Outlook tasks. Then you can view and track those tasks in Outlook and even get reminders.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/OneNote-Outlook.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="OneNote Outlook Flags"></p><p>You can also:</p><ul><li>Find a task in OneNote.</li><li>Mark a task as complete.</li><li>Delete a task.</li></ul><p>OneNote and Outlook work together in other ways too. For example, you can manage meeting details and send notes in an email message.</p><h2>7. Password-Protect your&#xA0;Notes</h2><p>Password protection in OneNote is designed to help keep your notes safe from prying eyes. Whether you use OneNote for class notes at school, meeting notes at work, a personal diary or blog at home, or personal information about yourself or your friends and family, passwords play a crucial part in controlling access to those notes.</p><p>You can help keep your private notes safe from prying eyes by protecting a OneNote notebook section with a password. When a section is password-protected, all of its pages are locked until you enter the correct password.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/OneNote-Passwor.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="OneNote Password Protect Section"></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Choose your password carefully. If you forget your password, no one will be able to unlock your notes for you (not even Microsoft Technical Support).</p><p>You can also:</p><ul><li>Lock the protected sections in your notebook.</li><li>Change the password for a protected section.</li><li>Remove the password from a protected section.</li><li>Set various password protection options.</li><li>See OneNote 2016 Help (F1).</li></ul><h2>8. Create &amp; Use Page Templates</h2><p>In OneNote, a template is a page design that you can apply to new pages in your notebook to give them an appealing background, a more uniform appearance, or a consistent layout.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/OneNote-Page-Te.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="OneNote Page Templates"></p><p>OneNote comes with several built-in page templates that you can choose from, including decorative page backgrounds, planners, and To Do lists. If you&#x2019;d like, you can also create your own page template or customize an existing one.</p><p>Note: Many template designs include content that appears in specific places on the page. For this reason, templates in OneNote can only be applied to new pages that don&#x2019;t already contain any notes. If you want to apply a template to a page that already contains notes, first create a new page from the template you want, and then copy your existing notes over to it.</p><h2>9. Organize Pages with&#xA0;Subpages</h2><p>Subpages are a good way to group and organize notes. For example, if you have annual and monthly meeting notes, the annual meeting notes can be a main page and you can demote the monthly meeting notes so they become subpages.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/OneNote-Subpage.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="OneNote Subpage Hide"></p><p>If you have a lot of notebooks and pages and notice that it&#x2019;s getting harder to find what you&#x2019;re looking for, you can search notes and navigate results. Another way to stay efficient is by organizing your notebooks, sections, and pages.</p><p>When you move a page that has subpages, the group moves together if the subpages are collapsed. If you want to move a single subpage, promote it to a page by dragging it to the left, and then click and drag the page up or down to the location you want.</p><h2>10. Use OneNote as a Team&#xA0;Wiki</h2><p>If you&#x2019;d like to share your notebook with other people, make sure you create your OneNote 2016 notebook on OneDrive so others can get to it. If you&#x2019;ve already created a notebook on your computer, first move it to OneDrive. Just because your notebook is on OneDrive doesn&#x2019;t mean people can automatically see it. It&#x2019;s available to you on all your devices. You&#x2019;ll have to deliberately share it with others before anyone else can see it.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/OneNote-Sharing1.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="OneNote Sharing"></p><ul><li>You can generate a link to your notebook so others can view or edit it (File tab &gt; Share &gt; Get a Sharing Link). If someone forwards the link to another person, they will also be able to see your notebook.</li><li>If you ever change your mind, you can change permissions or stop sharing your notebook. It will still be on OneDrive so you can get to it on all your devices.</li></ul><p>Thanks to OneNotes tags, and search capability it becomes a great place to use as a team wiki. When shared from OneDrive or SharePoint it becomes available offline too. I recommend a SharePoint Online site for teams of ten or more.</p><h3>Tips:</h3><ul><li>Follow a specific structure. Your first OneNote page should tell users how to use and update the OneNote.</li><li>Use Tags properly. They make it easy to find to-do lists, etc.</li><li>Chose an organization structure. At TierPoint, we group our notes by application / technology. Make OneNote work for you, not the other way around.</li></ul><h2>11. Manage Projects Through&#xA0;OneNote</h2><p>I manage a lot of projects through OneNote. I keep specific structures, templates, and notes for quick reuse. Here&#x2019;s my structure:</p><p>Create a section for every on going project. Name the section with the project name. Create a section group called <strong>Closed</strong>. When a project is completed, move it to the closed section.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/OneNote-Emptry-.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="OneNote Emptry Section"></p><p>The first page is always named the project name. It&#x2019;s a summary and where to keep important information I have to refer to often. Flag the title of the page so the project will show up in your Outlook To-do list.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/OneNote-Summary.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="OneNote Summary page of a project"></p><p>Then I create a page for <strong>Tasks</strong>. This list will typically be a list of things I have to do for every project like this. I&#x2019;ll create subpages with additional tasks. These are special things I need to complete for this particular project. I also create a meeting notes section. Every meeting I create a subpage with the notes from the meeting. Lastly, I&#x2019;ll create a <strong>Communications</strong> section where I dump important memos and emails that I&#x2019;ll need to reference later.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/OneNote-Tasks-P.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="OneNote Tasks Page"></p><h2>12. Outlook Meeting Notes</h2><p>OneNote is a fantastic place to store meeting notes. With simple integration into Outlook, it&#x2019;s as easy as a click of a button.</p><p>From an Outlook appointment click <strong>Meeting Notes</strong> under the <strong>Meeting</strong> ribbon.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/Outlook-Meeting.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="Outlook Meeting Notes Button for OneNote"></p><p>As the meeting organizer you can chose to share your notes with the other attendees or take private notes.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/OneNote-Meeting.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="OneNote Meeting Notes options. Shares notes or keep personal notes."></p><p>Next, chose the notebook and section where you want the notes to be stored.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/OneNote-share-w.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="OneNote share with meeting screen shot to select a location for your meeting notes."></p><p>OneNote will automatically add a ton of useful information to the OneNote page. For example, you can quickly see the time of the meeting, and it even adds check boxes so you can flag who arrived for the meeting.</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/OneNote-automat.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="OneNote automated meeting notes template."></p><p>If you chose to share the notes, a link will be automatically added to the meeting invitation. You can send a quick update and every can access your notes!</p><p><img src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/tips-for-onenote/OneNote-Shared-.png" layout="intrinsic" attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" alt="OneNote Shared Meeting Notes screen shot."></p><p>Meeting notes are a great addition to using OneNote to manage your projects.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Office 365 has a Bookings app included. Use Bookings to automate and streamline your scheduling.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="whats-microsoft-bookings">What&#x2019;s Microsoft Bookings?</h1><p>Microsoft has added the Microsoft Bookings app to Office 365 Enterprise (E3 &amp;
E5) customers. Bookings is an app that can simplify and automate how customers
schedule and manage appointments. Originally designed for small businesses,
Microsoft has continued to improve the product and has expanded the app to
enterprise customers.</p><p></p><h1 id="why-use-microsoft-bookings">Why use Microsoft Bookings?</h1><h2 id="customers-love-it">Customers Love it!</h2><p>Customers love the flexibility and convenience they have when using Bookings.
They can visit the simple Bookings webpage on any device and schedule an
appointment. After scheduling an appointment, they receive a confirmation email
and can reschedule, or cancel if they must. With Bookings, the process for
customers and prospective customers is easy, fast, and flexible.</p><h2 id="automate-and-streamline-scheduling">Automate and Streamline Scheduling</h2><p>Bookings will help automate and streamline scheduling. Employees can setup
available times, and set time off. Then customers can book their own
appointments so you don&#x2019;t waste time on the phone gathering information.
Bookings will keep your staff and customers coordinated, with little to no
effort.</p><p>Thanks to the Office 365 integration, your staff can continue to use their
Outlook calendar as usual. If a staff member schedules a meeting in their
Outlook calendar, they will automatically become unavailable in Bookings. The
synchronization makes adding Booking to someone&#x2019;s day simple, and easy.</p><p>When a customer books an appointment, the calendar item will automatically sync
to your staff&#x2019;s calendar, so they don&#x2019;t have to go hunting for their schedules
or manage their Booking calendar separate from their day to day calendar. The
two-way sync is beautifully designed to keep staff and customers happy.</p><h2 id="decrease-no-shows">Decrease No-Shows</h2><p>Decrease no-shows with automatic reminders for customers. After a customer books
an appointment they&#x2019;ll receive a confirmation of their booking directly in their
inbox. Customers can add their appointments to their own personal calendars to
make sure they remember the appointment in their busy lives. Bookings will send
a reminder email prior to the appointment.</p><h2 id="easy-to-use">Easy to Use</h2><p>Managing Bookings is easy to do, even on the go. With a web app and apps for
smart phones, you can keep up with customers and appointments in the office and
on the go. Use the app to email, call, or text customers or even add an
appointment for your customer.</p><h1 id="who-should-use-bookings">Who should use Bookings?</h1><p>Bookings is a fantastic app for most verticals. Add Bookings to your site and
offer a free consultation to help your organization grow. You can also use
Bookings with current customers to schedule appointments. Service organizations
for example, law firms, and insurance companies are finding online scheduling a
great way to help their organization grow.</p><h1 id="how-to-get-bookings">How to get Bookings</h1><p><strong>To get the free app added to your Office 365 enterprise, contact your
Microsoft partner. Your partner can give you access and assign the licenses
appropriately.</strong></p><h1 id="how-to-access-bookings">How to Access Bookings</h1><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L.

There are
a lot of different options that must be properly set prior to using the app. In
this section, I&#x2019;ll try to detail the configuration as best as possible.</p><h2 id="add-logo">Add Logo</h2><p>It&#x2019;s important to brand the site with your logo so customers feel comfortable.
Add your company logo by clicking the large add logo button in the top left.</p><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" layout="intrinsic" src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/bookings/add-logo.png" alt="Screenshot of add logo button" title="Screenshot of add logo button"></p><p>In the Business Logo pane, click <strong>Upload new logo</strong>. Upload your organizations
logo. The aspect ratio should be a square and the image should be smaller than
160x160.</p><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L.

It&#x2019;s best to
select a background color that will match your Bookings theme.</p><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" layout="intrinsic" src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/bookings/background-color-options.png" alt="screenshot of background color options" title="screenshot of background color options"></p><p>Click <strong>Save</strong> and your logo will appear in the Bookings website.</p><h2 id="setup-business-information">Setup Business Information</h2><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" layout="intrinsic" src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/bookings/business-information-page.png" alt="Business Information Page Screenshot" title="Screenshot of business information page in Microsoft Bookings"></p><p>Next, we&#x2019;ll need to update your business information. To setup your business
information for example, company name, address, and phone number click the
business information button in the bottom of the left navigation pane.</p><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" layout="intrinsic" src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/bookings/business-information-button.png" alt="business-information-button" title="business-information-button"></p><p>Your information will appear on the Bookings web page, fill in the common fields
as best as possible. The business hours will be used to limit the amount of
availability someone can schedule an appointment. By default, the hours will be
set to standard business hours. If you only want to accept appointments on one
day a week, adjust your business hours. Staff has their own business hours too.
Available hours are customizable for each employee on the Staff page too.</p><h2 id="how-to-add-staff">How to Add Staff</h2><p>Bookings will directly link your customers and prospective customers to your
staff. To add a staff member, click the Staff button in the left navigation
pane.</p><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" layout="intrinsic" src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/bookings/staff-button.png" alt="staff button" title="Microsoft Bookings staff button"></p><p>From the staff management page, you can see which staff members are connected to
Bookings or quickly add and remove staff members.</p><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" layout="intrinsic" src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/bookings/manage-staff-page.png" alt="Screenshot of staff management page" title="Screenshot of staff management page"></p><p>Clicking the Add staff button at the top will open the Staff details pane.</p><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" layout="intrinsic" src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/bookings/staff-details.png" alt="screenshot of Microsoft Bookings staff details page" title="staff details screenshot"></p><p>From the staff details pane, you can select a person in your company then edit
their availability, add phone numbers, etc. One of the latest features has added
the ability to sync Bookings availability with the person&#x2019;s calendar. If they
schedule an internal meeting during their available Bookings time, the time will
automatically be unavailable to customers!</p><p>Each staff can be assigned one of three roles: administrator, viewer, or guest.</p><ul><li>Administrators have full access to Bookings. They can add staff members, change any settings, etc. The administrator role should be limited to management, IT, and any employees that will manage Bookings.</li><li>Viewers can open the booking calendar but only view their own appointments. The Bookings calendar will automatically appear in an employee&#x2019;s OWA.</li><li>Guests can be assigned to bookings but can&#x2019;t open or change anything in Bookings. The appointments will automatically sync to their personal calendars. Guest access is recommended for most of the employees that handle the services.</li></ul><h2 id="how-to-configure-services">How to Configure Services</h2><p>When someone wants to book a time with your organization, one of the first
options they&#x2019;ll see is a list of services. To add services, go to the services
page by clicking <strong>Services</strong> in the left navigation pane.</p><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" layout="intrinsic" src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/bookings/services-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot showing the services option in Microsoft Bookings" title="Screenshot showing the services option in Microsoft Bookings"></p><p>To create a new service, click the <strong>Add a service</strong> button in the top toolbar.
From the Service details pane, you can easily create a service. The Service name
and description will be customer facing. They should be clear enough for
customers to understand what they&#x2019;re scheduling an appointment for.</p><p>Each service will have one or more staff members assigned. When scheduling an
appointment, a customer can either chose a staff member or one can be
automatically assigned based on availability.</p><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" layout="intrinsic" src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/bookings/service-details-page.png" alt="screenshot of service details page" title="screenshot of service details page"></p><p>Bookings does include a price option. If you set a price, the customer will see
the price when selecting the service. Unfortunately, there&#x2019;s no tie in back to
Office 365&#x2019;s invoicing capabilities but it&#x2019;s coming soon!</p><p>When finished save your new service.</p><h2 id="how-to-configure-the-booking-page">How to Configure the Booking Page</h2><p>The Booking page is the page customers will see when they want to book time. To
edit the booking page, click the <strong>Booking page</strong> button in the left navigation.</p><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" layout="intrinsic" src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/bookings/booking-page-button.png" alt="Booking Page Button" title="Booking Page Button"></p><p>From the Booking page you can update the theme, change the scheduling policy,
and publish the site. You&#x2019;ll need to remember to save and publish your site
prior to launch.</p><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" layout="intrinsic" src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/bookings/bookings-page.png" alt="screenshot of Microsoft Bookings page" title="screenshot of Microsoft Bookings page"></p><h2 id="how-to-publish-your-bookings-site">How to Publish your Bookings Site</h2><p>Bookings won&#x2019;t be live until you publish the site. Go to the <strong>Booking page</strong> by
clicking the <strong>Booking page</strong> button in the left navigation.</p><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" layout="intrinsic" src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/bookings/booking-page-button.png" alt="Booking Page Button" title="Booking Page Button"></p><p>Click the <strong>Save and publish</strong> button in the top toolbar.</p><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L.

You can share the link to
customers, then they can book appointments automatically.</p><h2 id="how-do-i-publish-booking-to-my-website">How do I Publish Booking to my Website?</h2><p>If you want prospective customers to schedule appointments, we&#x2019;ll need to add
the Bookings page to your site or a link to the Bookings site. Go to the <strong>Booking page</strong> by clicking the <strong>Booking page</strong> button in the left navigation.</p><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" layout="intrinsic" src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/bookings/booking-page-button.png" alt="Booking Page Button" title="Booking Page Button"></p><p>Once on the Booking page, click the <strong>Embed</strong> button in the top toolbar.</p><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L.

One is a link to your booking
page. The other is embeddable Iframe that can be placed directly into your
website. Give this code to your web developer to add them to your site.</p><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" layout="intrinsic" src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/bookings/bookings-embedables.png" alt="screenshot of Microsoft Bookings embedable links" title="screenshot of embedable links"></p><h2 id="what-s-the-employee-experience">What&#x2019;s the Employee Experience</h2><p>Since Bookings automatically links to your employees&#x2019; calendars, it&#x2019;s easy for
your staff to stay up-to-date. If an employee schedules an appointment on their
Outlook calendar they&#x2019;ll automatically be removed from the list of available
staff members in Bookings. If a customer books an appointment, the employees
calendar will be updated too.</p><p>When someone books an appointment without selecting a staff member, the
appointment will be automatically added to one of the available employees&#x2019;
calendars. The staff member will also receive an email informing them of the new
appointment. The appointment will contain the customer information in case they
need to reschedule or send some information prior to the engagement.</p><h2 id="what-s-the-customer-experience">What&#x2019;s the Customer Experience?</h2><p>Customers can easily book time without any issues. When they go to your Booking
site, they&#x2019;ll see a simple form where they can select a service, date and time
and then book a request.</p><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" layout="intrinsic" src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/bookings/Scheduling-Screenshot.png" alt="Scheduling-Screenshot" title="Scheduling-Screenshot"></p><p>After booking a time, they&#x2019;ll receive a confirmation message.</p><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" layout="intrinsic" src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/bookings/confirmation-dialog.png" alt="screenshot of confirmation dialog" title="screenshot of confirmation dialog"></p><p>Within minutes they&#x2019;ll receive a beautiful email reminding them of the
appointment.</p><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L. Gruber on GitBit" layout="intrinsic" src="http://gitbit.org/assets/article/bookings/confirmed-booking.png" alt="Booking confirmation screenshot" title="Booking confirmation screenshot"></p><p>The email is configured so apps like Gmail will request to put the appointment

Simply setup a merchant account, add fees to your Booking services and track
your payments. Payments is highly anticipated, especially for professional
services for example, law firms. Automated payment processing is currently in
development and expected to be released soon.</p><p><img attribution="CC courtesy of John L.
